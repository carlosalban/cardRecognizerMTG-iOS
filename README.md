Magic the Gathering Card Recognizer

iOS App that uses optical character recognition to query DB and return details of the card. Snapchat style app flow created with IB and code.

Past scans is empty by default until scans are made. Working on adding button to clear past scans as well as to indicate empty card history.

OCR needs more work on training.
