# cardRecognizerMTGiOS

Magic the Gathering Card Recognizer. Disclaimer: I wrote this code at the university level!

iOS App that uses optical character recognition to query DB and return details of the card. Snapchat style app flow created with IB and code.

Past scans is empty by default until scans are made. Working on adding button to clear past scans as well as to indicate empty card history.

OCR needs more work on training. API doesn't seem very reliable, looking for alternative or may build my own. If you get a network error, check if the API is down (address below).
